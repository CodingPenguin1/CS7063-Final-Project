## Abstract

Proper hyperparameter selection is critical to the performance Convolutional Neural Networks. Hyperparameter selection is typically performed manually and the quality of such choices entirely depend on the developer's experience and knowledge. However, no developer has absolute knowledge of what hyperparameters may be optimal. This paper discusses an attempt to optimize the hyperparameters of a convolutional neural network through use of an evolutionary algorithm.
